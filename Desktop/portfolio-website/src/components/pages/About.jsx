          My name is Micha≈Ç. I study Computer Science at Poznan University of
          Technology. Since I was a kid I always wondered how all things work
          and the most bizzare things were very often related to computers. So I
          immediately knew which path should I pursue in life. And that path was
          Computer Science.

          I'm mainly interested in developing software. I'm a member of an
          academic group (AKAI) which makes website apps. Our group often
          organize workshops and meetings with companies such as With-secure,
          appunite, N9ble, etc. For now i have experience only from working with
          AKAI and from my personal projects.
